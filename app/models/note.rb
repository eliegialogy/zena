A note is a 'dated' element. It is typically used for blog entries or/and calendar events.

=== dates

On top of the Node's dates (+created_at+, +updated_at+, +publish_from+), a note uses the following:

log_at::    used to sort/display blog entries
event_at::  used in calendars

These two dates enable you to announce an event in the blog list a couple of days before it actually occurs (event_at). All dates are stored internally as 'utc' and are converted to/from the visitor's current timezone.

=== links

Default links for Notes are:

calendars::  make this note appear in the given calendar (there is one calendar per project). By default the note is not included in its project's calendar.
projects::   make this note appear in the blog of the given project. A note always appear in its project.

=== subclasses


=== subclasses to implement before 1.0
Task::       manage things to be done (parent = Note = Todo). The parent provides the 'due date'.
Letter::     like the name says...
Request::    subclass of Todo. Manage user/client requests.
Bug::        (the class we most need!). subclass of Request.
Milestone::  special event used when choosing a Request/Bug's parent.
